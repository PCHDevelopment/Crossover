# Lead reviews

Periodic big-picture reviews by O1: is the merged code building the product in ARCHITECTURE.md, in the right order? Newest first.

## 2026-10-06 · Review 1 (42 of 112 tasks merged)

**State.** M1 done (ledger, leases, fencing, idempotency, dispatcher, publisher). M2 7/15 (participants, room create/state, tokens, authenticate, policy, scopes). M5 16/20 (the full ChangeSet apply pipeline with merge, conflicts, binary, ignore rules, ref reconciliation, reads, diff, history, blame). 929 tests, CI green. Quality is high: race tests are proven by sabotage, and contracts are decided before code.

**On track.**

- The core invariants of §19 and §10 are real and tested: gap-free sequences under one writer, fencing against zombie owners, atomic ChangeSets, PostgreSQL authoritative over Git with reconciliation, and idempotent replays.
- The layering is clean: protocol ← db ← ledger ← kernel ← workspace/policy, with policy injected (no kernel → policy dependency).

**Course corrections.**

1. **Nothing is runnable yet.** There's no `apps/server`, gateway or MCP server; six `register*` modules exist with nothing composing them, and the policy and `provisionWorkspace` are only wired in tests. All integration currently lands on T712 at the end. **Decision:** build a walking skeleton now. S1 takes T701 (REST gateway) right after T205; S2 takes T707 (MCP skeleton) and T710 (workspace tools) right after T517. O1 starts `apps/server` (T712's composition root) as soon as T701 lands, and grows the end-to-end test with every milestone instead of once at the end.
2. **The backlog didn't cover all of MVP scope (§29).** Git import/export, secret scanning, circuit breakers, budgets, approval gates and redaction had no tasks. Added as M8 (T801–T806) and M9 (T901–T906). Still to break down: sandboxes and execution (§14), the plugin runner, the web UI, the CLI and SDKs.
3. **Performance is unmeasured, and debt is accumulating against the p95 < 50 ms merge target (§3).** Full `ls-tree` per merge (T510), full index rebuild per patch op (T504), and an ignore-repo per materialize (T506). **Decision:** pull T519 (benchmark) forward to right after T518, and fix the hot spots it confirms before M6 builds more on the engine.

**Tech-debt register.**

- Non-strict zod schemas in `room.create` and `room.get_state`.
- Deferred FKs `rooms.owner_id`/`lead_participant_id`, pending a shared `createTestRoom` fixture.
- Compact `workspace.conflict.created` payloads (T601).
- No `capability.denied` events yet (T215).
- No background lease renewal (T713).
